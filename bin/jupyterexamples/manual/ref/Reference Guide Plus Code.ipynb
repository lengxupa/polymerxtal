A definitive answer depends on the user and on that user’s goals and experience. These Notebooks don't use Markdown because it's definitely better, but rather because it's different and thus encourages users to think about their work differently. \n",

    "It is very important for computer science students to learn how to conceptualize input and output as dependent, but also distinct. One good reason to use Markdown is that it encourages this kind of thinking. Relatedly, it might also promote focus on substance over surface aesthetic. Markdown is somewhat limited in its style options, which means that there are inherently fewer non-subject-specifc concerns to agonize over while working. It is the conceit of this philosophy that you would, by using Markdown and this Notebook, begin to think of the specific stylistic rendering of your cells as distinct from what you type into those same cells, and thus also think of the content of your writing as necessarily separate from its formating and appearance.
