    "## AtomMan https://github.com/usnistgov/atomman\n",
    "AtomMan: the Atomistic Manipulation Toolkit is a Python library for interacting with large-scale atomic systems. The focus of the package is to facilitate the rapid design and development of simulations that are fully documented and easily adaptable to new potentials/atomic arrangements/etc. All of the property calculation scripts in iprPy use atomman.\n",
    "* Allows for efficient and fast calculations on millions of atoms, each with many freely defined per-atom properties.\n",
    "* Create dislocation monopoles and evaluate them with differential displacement and Nye tensor plots.\n",
    "* Generate point defects.\n",
    "* Call LAMMPS directly from Python and instantly retrieve the resulting data or LAMMPS error statement.\n",
    "* Easily convert systems to/from the other Python atomic environments of ASE and PyMatGen.\n",
    "* Can create systems based on CIF crystal structure files, and LAMMPS atom and dump files.\n",
    "* Built-in unit conversions.\n",
